## AES
  Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm. AES encryption is used for securing sensitive but unclassified material by U.S. The AES engine requires a plain-text and a secret key for encryption and same secret key is used again to decrypt it.

## RSA
  RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an Asymmetric encryption technique that uses two different keys as public and private keys to perform the encryption and decryption. With RSA, you can encrypt sensitive information with a public key and a matching private key is used to decrypt the encrypted message. Asymmetric encryption is mostly used when there are 2 different endpoints are involved such as VPN client and server, SSH, etc.
